## How to get this running on my local machine

### Clone
- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/chiholiu10/react-redux-typescript-hooks`

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) 
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) 
- [Styled-Component](https://styled-components.com) 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

React has a very big community which is also backed by Facebook, furthermore there are also lot of rich packages that can be used in order to speed up the production process. Also Redux is a very great state management which helps Developers to easily and quickly track the states in any possible components. So in order words this helps to make the app more scalable and readable for future Developers. Redux when using it in the right way definitely makes apps very scalable and easy to maintain. In order to build high-performance app, using a linter like Eslint can track all problems which cannnot be seen with own eyes. Besides that they offer lot of options so Developers can adjust them to their own needs and requirements. With Styled Component you force yourself to get rid of classNames which makes the code more readable. Furthermore it makes the code lot cleaner since styles are created inside the folder with the corresponding React component and in case when adding tests it can also be put in the same folder. No need to scroll through large nested SASS or SCSS files or thinking too much about how to name different classnames. With TypeScript you can easilty refactor the code since it will show errors when changing name of functions. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### How to run the app
* npm install 
* npm run start

### How the app works
* Type title in input field
* Click randomly on 'More info'
* Popup will display on screen
* Click on 'Character Info'
* User will be redirected to page with more details
* Also possible to return back to previous page
* Responsive design included 

### Built some cool components with nice UX, for instance:
* Search input makes transition effect when scroll up or down
* Cool popup when user clicks on 'More info' button
* This popup block will also hide when user scroll up or down

### Check on linting error
* npm run lint

### Fixing linting error 
* npm run lint:fix 

### Deploy website
* npm run build
